    <h1>This is a sample document for translation testing.</h1>
    <p>
      This paragraph contains a significant amount of text to simulate
      real-world content. Here, we discuss various topics like science, history,
      and art. Let's delve into the fascinating world of astrophysics, where we
      explore the vast universe and the mysteries it holds. We can then travel
      back in time to delve into the rich tapestry of human history, from the
      rise and fall of empires to the development of groundbreaking inventions.
      Finally, let's shift gears and appreciate the beauty and creativity of the
      artistic world, encompassing everything from classical paintings to modern
      music. This is just a glimpse of the vast knowledge waiting to be
      explored.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another paragraph with more text. We can add details about
      specific scientific discoveries, historical events, or artistic movements.
      For instance, we could discuss the theory of relativity in astrophysics,
      the French Revolution in history, or the Impressionist movement in art.
      The possibilities are endless!

      This concludes our sample document. We hope it provides a good amount of
      text for testing translation functionality.
